# All My Fountains
*Chris Tomlin / Chris Tomlin / Chris Tomlin / Passion / Passion / Passion*

## Verse 1
This dry and desert land, I tell myself keep walking on
Here's something up ahead, water falling like a song
An everlasting stream, Your river carries me home, let it flow, let it flow

## Instrumental
All my fountains

## Verse 2
A flood for my soul,a well that never will run dry
I've rambled on my own, never believing I would find
An everlasting stream, Your river carries me home, let it flow, let it flow

## Chorus 1
Open the heavens, come living water, all my fountains are in You
Strong like a river, Your love is running through, all my fountains are in You

## Bridge 
Come on and rain down on us, rain down on us Lord

## Chorus 2
Open the heavens, come living water, all my fountains are in You
Strong like a river, Your love is running through, all my fountains are in You
Open the heavens, come living water, all my fountains are in You
Strong like a river, Your love is running through, all my fountains are in You
All my fountains are in You, All my fountains are in You
